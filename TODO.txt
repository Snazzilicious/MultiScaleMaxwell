1. Solve first order system
	a. show linearity
	b. use solution to Poisson's equation
	c. make sure have guage right
	d. Get to final solution
		i. use linearity to superimpose solutions for point currents and charges
2. Create second order system, and solve that
	a. show linearity
	b. see if this is any different from 1
		i. probably won't have e\cdot\nabla S = 0
3. Start with wave equation
	a. Show linearity
	b. see if this differs from 2
